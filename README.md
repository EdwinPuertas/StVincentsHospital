# St. Vincent Hospital
Hospital San Vicente is a high complexity health center located in the city of Cartagena. It has a capacity of 300 beds and serves about 1,000 patients per day. Currently, the hospital stores patients' medical records in physical files that are kept in the Archive area. When a physician needs to consult a patient's history, he or she must request the file from the Archive area and wait for it to be delivered. This generates a series of problems, such as. Delays in care, since they must wait for the physical delivery of the medical history. On average it takes 20 minutes. Risk of misplacing medical records, which happens in approximately 5% of requests. Difficulties in sharing patient information in real time among physicians from different specialties. Impossibility of generating reports and statistics from medical records data.
The hospital wishes to develop an information system to digitize and centralize patient records so that they are available online to authorized physicians and information can be obtained for hospital management. The minimum viable product required is to manage the electronic medical history of each patient, generate reports of indicators such as: percentage of hospital occupancy, average length of stay per service, number of admissions and discharges per service, patients with chronic diseases and prescription of medications per service.

The input data that will be requested from patients are the following:

Patient data (document, name, name, sex, date of birth).
Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, O2 saturation, respiratory rate).
Evolution notes
Diagnostic images
Laboratory test results
Prescribed medications
